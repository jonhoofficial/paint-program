<shape>.txt files are in an HTML structure. This meaning that it follows HTML coding protocols. The first and last line of a <shape>.txt file should always
have a <html> tag. In order to go to a new line in the tool tip simply put a <br> tag where you would like the new line to begin. <body> defines where the
text body begins and ends (similar syntax to <html> tag). The <body> tag is not necessarily needed in our project however, it is good practice when doing HTML
type files to include as many tags as possible. Please reference: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ for more possible tags. A sample <shape>.txt file is:

<html>
LOREM IPSUM:<br>
<body>
LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM <br>
LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM 
<body>
<html>

Which would produce an tipToolText like:
LOREM IPSUM:
LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM 
LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM LOREM IPSUM
